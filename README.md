<!-- CODING CHALLENGES -->

TASKS
1. Function: add_numbers (2 points)

Write a Python function named add_numbers that takes two parameters num1 and num2, and returns the sum of the two numbers.
2. Function: is_even (2 points)

Write a Python function named is_even that takes a single parameter number and returns True if the number is even, and False otherwise.

3. Function: reverse_string (2 points)

Write a Python function named reverse_string that takes a string text as input and returns the reversed version of that string.

4. Function: count_vowels (2 points)

Write a Python function named count_vowels that takes a string text as input and returns the count of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the string. Ignore case sensitivity.

5. Function: calculate_factorial (2 points)

Write a Python function named calculate_factorial that takes a non-negative integer n as input and returns the factorial of that number. The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

6. Function: apply_decorator (1 point)

Write a Python function named apply_decorator that takes a function func as input and applies a decorator named decorator_func. The decorator should simply print "Decorator Applied" before calling the original function.

7. Sequences: Sort List of Tuples (1 point)

Given a list of tuples where each tuple contains a name and an age, write a Python function named sort_by_age that sorts the list of tuples by age in ascending order.

8. Sets and Dictionaries: Merge Dictionaries (1 point)

Write a Python function named merge_dicts that takes two dictionaries as input and merges them into a single dictionary. If there are any common keys, their values should be summed up.

9. Object-Oriented Programming: Class Creation (2 points)

Define a Python class named Car with the following attributes: make, model, year. Implement a method named display_info that prints out the car's information.

<!-- Running the Code -->
To test your solutions for these challenges, follow these steps:

Open your preferred code editor or development environment.

Create a new Python file for the challenge (e.g. challenge.py)

Implement the corresponding functions according to the provided descriptions.

Save the file.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where your Python files are located.

Run the Python interpreter by typing python followed by the name of the file you want to test (e.g., python challenge.py).

In the Python interpreter, you can call the function with different inputs to verify its correctness.
